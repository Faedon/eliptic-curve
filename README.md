# Eliptic Curve Addition

P + Q = R is the additive property defined geometrically.

Elliptic curve groups are additive groups; that is, their basic function is addition. The addition of two points in an elliptic curve is defined geometrically.

The negative of a point P = (xP,yP) is its reflection in the x-axis: the point -P is (xP,-yP). Notice that for each point P on an elliptic curve, the point -P is also on the curve.
